    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p><b>EVERY DAY SINCE 2009;</b>
    Italianos® was proudly established in the <b>Philippines</b> in <b>2009</b> by <b>Ramon Julius Alday</b> and <b>Clark Daxen Jamora</b>, Old friends bonded by a shared love for Italian cuisine. Their inspiration came from a trip to Italy years ago, where they both fell in love with the rich flavors, warm culture, and comforting simplicity of Italian food. That unforgettable experience sparked a dream: <i>to bring the taste of Italy back home to the Philippines.</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Together, they built <b>Italianos®</b> with the goal of offering authentic, handcrafted Italian dishes that Filipinos could enjoy every day.
    At the heart of the kitchen is Head Chef <b>Aljay Ampado</b>, who studied culinary arts in Italy to fully master native Italian techniques and traditions. Chef <b>Aljay</b> brings authenticity to every dish—but with a uniquely Filipino twist. His signature style blends the bold, rustic flavors of Italy with the warmth and creativity of Filipino cuisine, giving every Filipino a taste of Italy that still feels close to home.
    <br>
    <br>
    Supporting him are his trusted assistant chefs, <b>Kenn Randy Biago</b> and <b>Reiner Flores</b>, who help bring the Italianos® vision to life—one plate at a time. From handmade pastas to wood-fired pizzas, everything at Italianos® is made from scratch and served with pride—every single day.

    <h2>How did We Start?</h2>
    <p>Italianos® began with a simple dream shared by two old friends, <b>Ramon Julius Alday</b> and <b>Clark Daxen Jamora</b>. During a trip to Italy, they found themselves captivated by the country's rich food culture—fresh ingredients, homemade pastas, wood-fired pizzas, and meals that brought people together like family. That unforgettable experience lit a spark in both of them.
    <br>
    <br>
    When they returned to the Philippines, they knew they wanted to recreate that same warmth and flavor for Filipino diners. In 2009, they opened <b>Italianos®</b>, not just a restaurant, but a passion project built on friendship, travel, and love for Italian cuisine.
    To bring their vision to life, they teamed up with Chef <b>Aljay Ampado</b>, a Filipino chef who studied culinary arts in Italy. Chef <b>Aljay</b> brings not only authentic Italian techniques to the kitchen but also a unique twist—infusing each dish with a subtle Filipino flavor, making every bite familiar yet exciting.
    Supported by assistant chefs <b>Kenn Randy Biago</b> and <b>Reiner Flores</b>, the Italianos team has been proudly serving handcrafted, made-from-scratch Italian dishes with a Filipino soul since day one.

    <h2>How do we make our Food?</h2>
    <p>At Italianos®, authenticity is at the <b>heart of every dish</b> we serve. We believe that true Italian flavor starts with quality ingredients and time-honored techniques—so we make sure to use both.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our recipes are crafted using native Italian ingredients from San Marzano tomatoes and Parmigiano-Reggiano to extra virgin olive oil and imported Italian herbs. These ingredients are carefully sourced to preserve the integrity of traditional Italian cuisine, ensuring every bite feels like it came straight from a kitchen in Rome or Naples.
    <br>
    <br>
    But ingredients alone aren't enough. Our dishes are prepared under the guidance of Head Chef <b>Aljay Ampado</b>, who studied culinary arts in Italy and brings with him a deep understanding of authentic Italian cooking. Every plate reflects the knowledge, discipline, and soul of true Italian tradition—blended with a touch of Filipino creativity to make it even more special for local tastes.
    We make everything from scratch—our pasta is hand-rolled, our sauces are slow-cooked, and our pizzas are stone-baked to perfection. No shortcuts, just honest food made the Italian way, <i>every single day</i>.
